This is the code I plan to use for my Make Fair project recreating the Selfie Photo Booth from Make: magazine Vol. 52. This will contain stuff that is borrowed from other people. I will do my best to add citations as needed. If I find issues with the instructions I hope to annotate that as well.

The projects that I am modeling this off of are as follows;
